  <h1>The Rise of Micro-Influencers in Marketing</h1>
  <p><strong>Published:</strong> September 22, 2025</p>
  <p>
    In today’s crowded digital world, brands are turning to micro-influencers—creators with smaller but highly engaged audiences—to drive authentic connections and sales.
  </p>

  <h2>👥 Who Are Micro-Influencers?</h2>
  <p>
    Micro-influencers typically have between 1,000 to 100,000 followers. Unlike celebrities, their content feels relatable and trustworthy, which resonates strongly with niche communities.
  </p>

  <h2>💡 Why Brands Love Them</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Higher Engagement:</strong> Their audiences interact more actively with posts.</li>
    <li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> They promote products they genuinely use and believe in.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Partnerships are often more affordable than celebrity endorsements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📊 Impact on Marketing</h2>
  <p>
    Campaigns with micro-influencers often outperform those with big names when it comes to ROI. They drive conversations, build trust, and create a sense of community around a brand.
