      The Law of Attraction isn’t just for dreamers — it’s a tool for entrepreneurs, brand creators, and marketers. In business, mindset matters as much as marketing.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">1. You Attract What You Believe</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      If you truly believe your brand is valuable, others will too. Confidence is contagious. Doubt, on the other hand, repels success.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">2. Visualize Your Audience</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      You can’t attract who you haven’t imagined. Build a mental picture of your dream clients. Who are they? What do they want? What do they fear?
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">3. Your Energy Is Your Brand</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Every piece of content you post, every word on your site, every email you send — it all transmits a frequency. What vibe are you putting out?
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">4. Action Aligns With Attraction</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      The Law of Attraction doesn’t mean doing nothing. You align your actions with your desires. Build, show up, share, refine — and trust the compound effect.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-8 italic text-gray-400">
      At Daboubi, we mix energy with execution. Belief with behavior. Our strategies not only get results — they attract the right people, at the right time, in the right way.
