      Nobody teaches you the raw truth about money in school. It’s mostly sugarcoated or ignored. But money is a game — and if you don’t learn the rules early, you pay for it later.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">💸 1. Time is more expensive than money</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      You can always make more money. But once time is gone, it never comes back. Stop wasting years undercharging, overthinking, or waiting to “feel ready.”
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">📉 2. Saving alone won’t make you rich</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Cutting back on coffee won’t change your life. Learning to create value, sell it, and scale it will. Saving is defensive. Wealth comes from playing offense.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">🔒 3. No one’s coming to save you</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Don’t rely on “luck” or someone discovering you. Start the thing. Sell the skill. Build the system. Take responsibility for the income you want.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Once you stop expecting money to find you — and start treating it like a craft to master — everything changes.
    </p>
