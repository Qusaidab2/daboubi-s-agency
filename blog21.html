      You see them every day. Flashy ads. Big promises. Loud colors. And yet — they barely convert. Why? Because most ads forget the most important rule:
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">🧠 People Don’t Want to Be Sold To</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      They want to be understood. They want connection. Relevance. Trust. And most ads don’t offer any of that — they just scream.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">📉 The Old Way Is Dead</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      The old “Buy Now!” method is lazy. Audiences today are sharp. You have 3 seconds to grab attention — and you better lead with emotion, not a discount.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">✅ Here’s What Works</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
      <li>Start with a pain point or desire — not a product.</li>
      <li>Use storytelling and visuals that feel human, not robotic.</li>
      <li>Build curiosity, not pressure.</li>
      <li>Make them feel like it’s their idea to click.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="italic text-gray-400">
      At Daboubi, we craft ads people actually want to see — and click.
