      In a sea of competitors, only a few brands stand out — and even fewer stay in people’s minds. So what makes a brand unforgettable? Here are the essentials.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">1. Clear Personality</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Is your brand funny, bold, elegant, or rebellious? People remember *characters*, not corporations. Give your brand a voice and tone people can connect with.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">2. Consistent Messaging</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Repetition builds memory. Use the same phrases, colors, style, and mission across every platform — your website, social media, ads, and even emails.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">3. Emotional Connection</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Memorable brands make people *feel* something. Whether it’s trust, confidence, nostalgia, or excitement — emotion locks you in people’s brains.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">4. Simplicity</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Simple is sticky. A brand with a clear offer and one powerful idea is easier to recall than one trying to be everything to everyone.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">5. Bold Visual Identity</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Strong colors. Unique logo. Clean design. People remember what they see — so design like it matters (because it does).
    </p>

    <p class="mt-8 italic text-gray-400">
      At Daboubi, we build brands that stay in people’s minds long after they close the tab. And the results? They speak for themselves.
