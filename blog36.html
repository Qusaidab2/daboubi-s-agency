    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gold mb-4">Why You're Not Making Money Online (Yet)</h1>
    <p class="text-gray-400 mb-8">Posted on July 29, 2025</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Let’s be brutally honest — the internet is full of people claiming they make $10K/month from dropshipping, UGC, affiliate marketing, AI prompts, trading crypto, or launching a personal brand.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">And yet… most people are stuck making $0 online. Why?</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gold mt-8 mb-2">❌ Reason 1: You're Consuming, Not Creating</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">You binge YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram thinking it's “research,” but the truth is — you're stuck in consumption mode. Real money flows to those who create value, not those who scroll.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gold mt-8 mb-2">❌ Reason 2: You Chase Trends Without Mastery</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Every week, there's a new side hustle trend. AI automations, Notion templates, Shopify flipping. But if you don’t stick with one and master it, you’ll stay broke. You don’t need 10 skills. You need one that makes you money.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gold mt-8 mb-2">✅ The Truth: The Internet Rewards Speed + Depth</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">If you can do one thing fast and do it well — you’re already ahead of 90% of people. Copywriting, video editing, storytelling, design, marketing — these are the real currencies of the internet.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gold mt-8 mb-2">✨ Here's the 3-Step Framework to Fix It:</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li><strong>Pick One Path:</strong> Choose a model — service, product, content, or affiliate. Stick with it for 90 days.</li>
      <li><strong>Build in Public:</strong> Share your journey. Create daily. Post value. People buy from visibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Sell Early:</strong> Don’t wait until you’re an expert. Start charging small, then scale as you improve.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gold mt-8 mb-2">🧠 Keywords People Are Searching Right Now</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">We ran the top trending Google queries and here’s what everyone’s looking for (and why it matters):</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li><strong>“How to make money online”</strong> – Still #1 after years. Desire for independence.</li>
      <li><strong>“ChatGPT prompts to get rich”</strong> – AI is the new gold rush.</li>
      <li><strong>“Side hustle ideas 2025”</strong> – People are desperate for backup income.</li>
      <li><strong>“How to build a personal brand”</strong> – Visibility equals leverage.</li>
      <li><strong>“AI girlfriend app”</strong> – Loneliness in the digital age.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gold mt-8 mb-2">💡 Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">You’re not behind — but you do need to shift. From passive scrolling to focused action. From watching others win to building your own brand. Use your voice. Solve a problem. Monetize your creativity.</p>

    <p class="mb-4 font-semibold text-gold">Because the internet doesn’t pay the smartest — it pays the boldest.</p>
