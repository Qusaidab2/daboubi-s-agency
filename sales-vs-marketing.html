  <h1>The Differences Between Sales and Marketing</h1>
  <p><strong>Published:</strong> June 27, 2025</p>
  <p>
    Sales and marketing are often used interchangeably—but they are not the same. While they both aim to increase revenue, they take very different approaches to get there.
  </p>

  <h2>📈 What Is Marketing?</h2>
  <p>
    Marketing is the process of creating awareness, interest, and demand for a product or service. It involves understanding the market, building a brand, and attracting potential customers through content, ads, SEO, and more.
  </p>

  <h2>💼 What Is Sales?</h2>
  <p>
    Sales focuses on converting leads into paying customers. It’s more direct and personal—often involving meetings, calls, negotiations, and follow-ups to close deals.
  </p>

  <h2>🔍 Key Differences</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Marketing generates leads; sales converts them.</li>
    <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Marketing is long-term; sales is short-term.</li>
    <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Marketing is broad; sales is targeted.</li>
    <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Marketing uses content, social media, ads; sales uses CRMs, calls, pitches.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🤝 How They Work Together</h2>
  <p>
    When sales and marketing align, businesses grow faster. Marketing warms up leads, and sales takes them across the finish line. Communication between both teams is key.
