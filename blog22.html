      Branding isn’t just logos and colors — it’s how people feel when they see your name. And if they don’t feel anything, you don’t have a brand — you have a product.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">🧬 What Makes a Brand Stick?</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      It’s story. It’s personality. It’s how consistently you show up — and whether people trust you. Your brand should speak before you do.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">🔥 The Emotional Hook</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      People don’t remember features. They remember how you made them feel. Build your brand around emotions: ambition, freedom, love, power — pick your theme and double down.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">🛠️ Action Steps</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
      <li>Write your brand’s one-sentence story. Keep it emotional.</li>
      <li>Design everything — from tone to visuals — to reflect that story.</li>
      <li>Repeat it everywhere. On socials. Emails. Website. Stick to it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="italic text-gray-400">
      A strong brand doesn’t chase attention — it attracts loyalty.
