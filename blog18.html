      Crypto went from hype to fear to something in-between. Now that the dust is settling — is it still worth your attention, your energy, or your money?
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">📊 Volatility Is the Point</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      The biggest mistake people make is expecting crypto to behave like a traditional asset. It doesn't. It’s not just about price — it’s about movement, disruption, and long-term positioning.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">🔐 The Real Value Isn’t in Coins</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      The real value lies in blockchain infrastructure, smart contracts, tokenized ownership, and decentralized tools. Coins are just the surface — the iceberg is beneath.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">💡 Should You Invest?</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      If you're expecting overnight riches — don’t. But if you’re ready to research, adapt, and hold long-term, crypto still offers unmatched opportunity.
