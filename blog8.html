      Trust isn’t something you ask for — it’s something you earn. And no, you don’t need to be famous or have 10k followers to build it. Here’s how to start strong.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">1. Show Your Face</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      People trust people — not faceless brands. Use your story, your journey, your voice. Even if it's not perfect, it's *real* — and that matters more.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">2. Be Consistent</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Whether it's content, tone, or delivery — consistency creates reliability. When people know what to expect from you, they start to trust you naturally.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">3. Offer Value First</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Before you sell anything, teach something. Help, guide, or inspire your audience with no strings attached. When people benefit from you, they believe in you.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">4. Be Transparent</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Don’t fake results or copy others. Share your truth — the wins *and* the struggles. People trust honesty over perfection, especially in today’s world.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">5. Stay Human</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Be kind. Reply to comments. Own your mistakes. Stay humble. The more you behave like a human and not just a “brand,” the more your audience connects.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-8 italic text-gray-400">
      At Daboubi, we help brands build real connections — not fake impressions. Whether you’re starting from zero or scaling up, we’ll show you how to win trust the right way.
