      Some traps are obvious. Others are dressed up as “opportunities.” If you don’t know how to spot them, you’ll end up broke — or worse, stuck.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">💳 1. Buy Now, Cry Later</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Credit cards, “0% interest” loans, and payment plans are sold as freedom. In reality, they’re slow poison.
      If you can’t afford it now, you probably shouldn’t be paying for it later — with interest.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">🏘️ 2. The Fake Dream of Ownership</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Just because you “own” a house doesn’t mean it’s building your wealth. If it’s draining you with maintenance, taxes, and interest — it may be a financial anchor, not a ladder.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">📉 3. High Income ≠ Wealth</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Many people fall into the trap of lifestyle inflation. As income grows, so do expenses.
      But wealth isn’t what you earn. It’s what you keep, multiply, and protect.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Financial traps are everywhere — flashy, seductive, and silent. The only way out is awareness.  
      Study the game. Play smart. Think long-term.
