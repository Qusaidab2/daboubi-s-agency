      Ever walked into a store for one item and walked out with five? That wasn’t an accident. It was designed. 
      The psychology of spending is built on triggers — and if you don’t recognize them, you’ll be ruled by them.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">🧠 1. Emotional Anchoring</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Brands don’t sell products. They sell feelings. A new perfume isn’t just a scent — it’s confidence in a bottle. 
      When you’re feeling low, these promises become harder to resist.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">🛒 2. The Illusion of Urgency</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      “Only 2 left in stock.” “Sale ends in 3 hours.” These scarcity cues trigger your survival brain. 
      But most of the time, the urgency is manufactured. Walk away, and you'll realize you never needed it in the first place.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">💡 3. Spending = Control</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      When life feels chaotic, shopping gives the illusion of control. “At least I chose this.”  
      But real power is in choosing not to be manipulated.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Understand your urges. Question the impulse. Financial freedom begins where emotional spending ends.
    </p>

      “You don’t just spend money — you spend time, energy, and freedom. Spend wisely.”
