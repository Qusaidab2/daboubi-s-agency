      <p>In today’s fast-paced world, knowledge and skills are valuable, but connections are often what open doors. Networking is more than exchanging business cards or adding LinkedIn contacts—it’s about creating genuine relationships that can bring opportunities, insights, and support.</p>

      <p>Think of networking as planting seeds. Every conversation, every introduction, every collaboration is an investment that may blossom into something bigger later on. Many successful entrepreneurs, leaders, and professionals can trace their breakthroughs back to a simple introduction or a supportive mentor.</p>

      <p>One of the biggest advantages of networking is access. You gain access to opportunities you might never find online, from partnerships to job offers to investment possibilities. But it works best when it’s reciprocal. Give before you expect to receive—share your knowledge, offer help, and show up consistently.</p>

      <p>Another hidden strength of networking is learning. Every person you meet carries a unique perspective. Conversations spark ideas, expose you to new industries, and challenge your assumptions. Over time, this creates a wider worldview and makes you more adaptable in business and life.</p>

      <p>In short, networking is the currency of success because it compounds. Like money, relationships grow in value the more you nurture them. Start small: attend events, join communities, and reach out to people you admire. With time, your network becomes one of your greatest assets.</p>
