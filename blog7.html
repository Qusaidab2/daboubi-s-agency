      In a world full of noise, only a few brands truly stick in people’s minds. The secret? It's not about having the best logo — it's about creating *emotional fingerprints*.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">1. A Strong Core Identity</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      A memorable brand knows exactly what it stands for — its mission, voice, and purpose. It doesn’t try to be everything to everyone. It stands for something, even if that means not pleasing everyone.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">2. Consistent Visuals & Voice</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      From colors and fonts to how you speak — consistency builds recognition. People remember patterns, not randomness. A brand that repeats itself clearly gets remembered.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">3. Emotional Triggers</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      What does your brand make people *feel*? That’s the glue. Whether it’s trust, pride, or excitement — emotion creates loyalty far beyond logic.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">4. Storytelling</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Humans connect with stories. The more you tell stories — of your origin, your mission, your clients — the more people remember you as something *real*, not just a business.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">5. A Clear Promise</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Memorable brands make a promise — and keep it. They solve one clear problem, they deliver one clear result, and they repeat that message until it becomes a truth in people’s minds.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-8 italic text-gray-400">
