      Most people focus too much on perfecting their product. But if no one cares who you are or what you stand for, even the best product wonâ€™t get the attention it deserves.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">ðŸ“¦ The Harsh Truth</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Average products with powerful branding outsell great products with no identity. Every. Single. Time.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">âš¡ People Donâ€™t Buy Products â€” They Buy Feelings</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      A brand tells a story. It creates emotional attachment. It speaks for your audience before your product ever does. Think Nike, Apple, or Tesla â€” itâ€™s not the features, itâ€™s the *feeling*.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">ðŸ”‘ Build the Brand First</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Focus on values, voice, and visual identity. Be consistent. Be bold. When people know what you stand for, theyâ€™ll trust what you sell.
    </p>
