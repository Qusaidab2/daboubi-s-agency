      Artificial intelligence is no longer just a trend — it’s a massive opportunity. With tools like ChatGPT, you have a 24/7 assistant, strategist, writer, and idea machine in your pocket. Here’s how to turn AI into income.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">1. Use ChatGPT to Build & Launch Fast</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Got a business idea? ChatGPT can help you name it, write the copy, suggest the branding, and even structure your product launch. What used to take months now takes hours.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">2. Automate Content & Strategy</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Whether it’s blog posts, captions, emails, or ad copy — ChatGPT can generate, refine, and repurpose content to grow your audience and convert leads, faster than ever before.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">3. Think Smarter, Work Less</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Ask ChatGPT for money-making ideas, passive income streams, niche analysis, or productivity tips. AI doesn’t just save time — it multiplies brainpower.
    </p>
