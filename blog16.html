      All online marketing is marketing — but not all marketing is online. Understanding the difference helps you choose the right strategies and win in today’s digital-first world.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">1. Traditional Marketing: Offline Roots</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Traditional marketing includes TV ads, billboards, radio, flyers, newspapers — anything that exists *offline*. It's about mass awareness, physical presence, and brand repetition in real life.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">2. Online Marketing: Targeted & Trackable</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Online marketing lives on the internet: social media ads, SEO, email campaigns, influencer partnerships. It’s faster, cheaper, and data-driven. You can target people specifically and adjust instantly.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">3. Which One Is Better?</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      It depends on your brand. But today, if you’re not online — you’re invisible. Online marketing gives every business, small or big, the power to compete, scale, and connect globally.
    </p>
