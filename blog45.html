    <p class="text-gray-400 mb-8">Posted on August 8, 2025</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Let’s be honest: being broke isn’t always about how much money you make. Often, it’s about how you think, spend, and react to the world around you.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Many people are caught in a cycle that looks like this: earn → spend → stress → repeat. Even those who increase their income often find that their expenses grow to match (or exceed) it. This is called “lifestyle inflation,” and it’s one of the most dangerous traps.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">So, why do most people stay broke?</h2>

    <p class="mb-4"><strong>1. Emotional Spending:</strong> Buying things to feel better is one of the fastest ways to stay financially stuck. Retail therapy might feel good for a moment, but the high fades quickly, leaving only the bill behind.</p>

    <p class="mb-4"><strong>2. Lack of Financial Education:</strong> Most schools don’t teach how to manage money, budget, or invest. So unless you actively seek it out, you may not even know how to escape the paycheck-to-paycheck loop.</p>

    <p class="mb-4"><strong>3. Instant Gratification Culture:</strong> We live in a world of one-click orders and same-day delivery. The idea of waiting to buy something, or saving up for it, feels foreign. But impulse buys are usually the most regrettable.</p>

    <p class="mb-4"><strong>4. Keeping Up With Others:</strong> Social media pressures us to “look successful.” But flexing with new shoes or a vacation you can’t afford just digs the hole deeper. Real wealth isn’t loud — it’s quiet, disciplined, and often invisible.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">How to break the cycle</h2>

    <p class="mb-4"><strong>1. Track Every Dinar (or Dollar):</strong> Awareness is the first step. For one month, write down every expense. You’ll be shocked how much slips away unnoticed — coffees, late-night food, apps, subscriptions.</p>

    <p class="mb-4"><strong>2. Build a Delay Buffer:</strong> Before any non-essential purchase, pause. Ask: “Do I need this right now? Or am I chasing a feeling?” Often, a 24-hour wait kills the impulse.</p>

    <p class="mb-4"><strong>3. Set a Real, Emotional Goal:</strong> “Save money” is too vague. But “I want to save 1,000 JOD to take my mom on a trip” lights up your brain emotionally — and you’ll be more likely to follow through.</p>

    <p class="mb-4"><strong>4. Learn About Money Weekly:</strong> Watch one video, read one post, or listen to one podcast about money each week. Small steps = major mindset shifts.</p>

    <p class="mb-4"><strong>5. Surround Yourself With Growth:</strong> If your friends mock savings or brag about debt, it’s time to upgrade your circle. You become who you’re around — financially, mentally, emotionally.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Final thoughts</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">Being broke doesn’t mean you’re lazy or doomed. But if you keep repeating the same patterns, you’ll keep getting the same results. Change doesn’t happen overnight — but it does happen with small, consistent steps in a new direction.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Choose your future with intention. Your bank account will thank you later.</p>
