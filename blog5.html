  <h1 style="text-align: center;">How to Make Money Online in 2025</h1>
  <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto;">
    <p>In 2025, making money online is no longer a dream — it's a skill. Here's how people are earning real income:</p>

    <h2>1. Personal Branding</h2>
    <p>Those who position themselves as experts on platforms like TikTok, YouTube, or LinkedIn are monetizing faster than ever. People pay for attention — and you can be the one getting paid.</p>

    <h2>2. Freelancing on Demand</h2>
    <p>Upwork, Fiverr, and specialized communities (like design, marketing, or AI-related groups) are booming. But success depends on positioning, not just talent.</p>

    <h2>3. AI-Powered Agencies</h2>
    <p>With tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and automation platforms, you can run a one-person business that feels like a team of ten.</p>

    <h2>4. Affiliate Marketing</h2>
    <p>2025 affiliate programs offer higher commissions, smarter tracking, and AI-generated content support. But your success depends on trust and traffic — not just links.</p>

    <h2>5. Selling Digital Products</h2>
    <p>Courses, templates, code, Notion systems, and even AI prompts are being sold every second. What knowledge do you have that others would pay for?</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 30px;"><strong>Final Tip:</strong> Don't chase trends. Build assets — skills, content, brand, or systems — and let the internet work for you.</p>
