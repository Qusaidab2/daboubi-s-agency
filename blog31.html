      Ever bought something you didn’t really need — and then wondered *why* you did it?
      Welcome to the emotional world of spending. It’s rarely logical. It’s psychological.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">🧠 1. You’re not buying the product. You’re buying how it makes you feel.</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      That new phone? Not just tech. It’s status. That skincare set? Not just lotion. It’s confidence.
      Marketers sell emotions. And we fall for it — over and over again.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">🛍️ 2. Instant gratification beats long-term logic</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Dopamine is a powerful drug. One click, and you feel rewarded. The brain loves “now” more than “later.”
      That’s why waiting 3 days before buying something often kills the desire completely.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">💔 3. You spend to escape discomfort</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Bored? Buy. Lonely? Buy. Stressed? Scroll and buy. Many purchases are self-medication in disguise.
      If you master your emotions, you’ll master your wallet.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Start asking: “What emotion am I trying to buy right now?” That question alone can save you thousands.
