      Safety feels good. It feels logical. Predictable. Secure.
      But over time, playing it safe becomes its own form of risk — a silent tax on your potential.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">🎭 Comfort is Expensive</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      The real price of “stability” is:
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>Opportunities missed</li>
        <li>Ideas untested</li>
        <li>Years you’ll never get back</li>
      </ul>
      What you don’t try, you’ll never master. And what you avoid out of fear becomes your ceiling.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">🚀 Growth Requires Friction</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Every leap forward has a little chaos in it. Whether it's launching a project, raising your prices, or starting that scary new thing — discomfort is the signal you’re alive.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="italic text-gray-400 border-l-4 border-gold pl-4 mb-6">
      “Safe keeps you small. Brave gets you free.”
    </blockquote>

    <p class="mb-6">
      The truth? You don’t need more time. You need more nerve.  
      Risk isn’t the enemy — stagnation is.
