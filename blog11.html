      Viral content isn’t an accident — it’s psychology in action. Great marketers don’t just create, they trigger emotions. Here’s how viral marketing truly works.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">1. Emotions Drive Sharing</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Content that triggers awe, laughter, or even anger gets shared more. People don’t share facts — they share feelings. If your content doesn’t make someone feel, it won’t spread.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">2. Social Proof Sparks Action</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      We copy what others are doing. That’s human nature. Show your content is being liked, saved, or commented on — and others will follow.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">3. Make People Look Smart or Funny</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      People share things that make them look good. Help them say something clever, unique, or insightful — and they’ll repost you to boost their own image.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">4. Simplicity Wins</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      The brain craves clarity. Viral posts are usually short, punchy, and easy to understand. One big idea beats five scattered ones.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">5. Relatability = Shareability</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      If people say “that’s so me” or “I’ve been through that,” they’ll tag their friends. Speak to the shared human experience, and you win.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-8 italic text-gray-400">
