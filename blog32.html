      It’s not luck. It’s not just hard work. It’s mindset, habits, and systems.
      If you’ve ever wondered why the wealth gap keeps growing — this will explain it.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">💡 1. The Rich Think in Assets, the Poor Think in Expenses</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      A wealthy person buys things that generate income: stocks, real estate, businesses.
      A poor person buys things that lose value: new phones, clothes, liabilities.
      The result? One grows wealth. The other chases lifestyle.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">⏳ 2. The Rich Use Time to Multiply Money</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Compound interest. Passive income. Long-term investments. The rich use time like a tool.
      The poor trade time for money — and spend it as fast as they earn it.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">🧠 3. Financial Education Is the Real Inheritance</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Rich families pass down knowledge. Poor families often pass down stress and survival skills.
      It’s not about how much you make — it’s about what you know and how you use it.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      If you want to escape the cycle, start studying money like your future depends on it. Because it does.
    </p>

      “Money doesn’t change you. It reveals your habits — at scale.”
