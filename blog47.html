    <p class="text-gray-400 mb-8">Posted on August 10, 2025</p>

    <p class="mb-4">In 2025, small businesses face more competition than ever before — not just from local rivals, but from global giants with billion-dollar budgets. The good news? Digital tools, niche targeting, and authentic branding have leveled the playing field like never before.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Leverage your biggest advantage: Agility</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Unlike big corporations, small businesses can adapt quickly to trends, personalize customer experiences, and make decisions without layers of bureaucracy. This speed can be your superpower in a rapidly changing market.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Focus on niche markets</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Big brands try to please everyone — which often means they end up being generic. You can win by deeply understanding a specific audience and serving them better than anyone else.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Build a brand story</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Customers connect with people, not faceless corporations. Share your journey, your mission, and your values in a way that makes customers feel they’re part of your success.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Master digital marketing</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li>Use social media for direct engagement, not just promotion.</li>
      <li>Run targeted ads with small but strategic budgets.</li>
      <li>Leverage SEO and content marketing to attract organic traffic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Deliver unmatched customer service</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Big brands may have more resources, but they can’t replicate the personal touch of a small business. Go above and beyond for your customers — they’ll remember it and spread the word.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Collaborate instead of compete</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Partner with other small businesses to expand your reach, share audiences, and create win-win opportunities. Collaboration is a growth multiplier.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">In 2025, small businesses that embrace innovation, authenticity, and community can not only survive but thrive — even against industry giants.</p>
