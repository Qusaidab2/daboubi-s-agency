    <p class="mb-6">
      The client of 2025 is not like the client from 2015. They're smarter, faster, and more aware of fake promises. So what do they really want now?
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">1. Real Results — Not Fluff</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Clients are tired of “engagement” and “exposure.” They want tangible growth — sales, leads, retention. Speak the language of numbers, not empty metrics.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">2. Clear Communication</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Fast responses. Transparent timelines. No guesswork. If you’re easy to work with, you’re already more valuable than 80% of freelancers out there.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">3. Simplicity Over Complexity</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Clients don’t want long reports or complicated strategies. They want clear direction and easy wins. Simplify your value and you’ll be remembered.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">4. A Sense of Partnership</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Clients don’t want to feel like a number. They want to feel like you care about their success as much as your own. Treat their business like it’s yours.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">5. Proof of Competence</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Portfolios, testimonials, or even just how you speak — confidence builds trust. Show that you know what you’re doing, and they’ll follow you.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-8 italic text-gray-400">
