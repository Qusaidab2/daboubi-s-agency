      It’s not money. It’s not time. And it’s definitely not the market.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      The biggest reason people don’t start businesses? <strong>Fear of looking stupid.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">💥 The Psychology Behind It</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
      <li>“What if it fails?” → You’re afraid people will say “I told you so.”</li>
      <li>“What if no one buys?” → You’re afraid of rejection.</li>
      <li>“What if I make mistakes?” → You’re afraid of being seen as unqualified.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Most people would rather stay broke than risk embarrassment. That’s the real trap.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">🚪 Escape the Mental Jail</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
      <li>Embrace being a beginner. Everyone starts rough.</li>
      <li>Real power is in taking action before you're "ready".</li>
      <li>Let success be your revenge — not perfection.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Every successful entrepreneur has once been laughed at, doubted, or ignored. The difference? They moved anyway.
    </p>

    <p class="italic text-gray-400">
      If you’re not willing to look stupid for a while, you’ll stay invisible forever.
