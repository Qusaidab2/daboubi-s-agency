      Every entrepreneur faces dry seasons — no leads, no sales, and lots of self-doubt. But this isn’t the end. It’s just a test. Here’s how to stay fired up when things get quiet.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">1. Remember Why You Started</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Go back to your “why.” The vision, the freedom, the change you wanted to create. Your purpose is bigger than the slump you’re in.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">2. Focus on What You Can Control</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      You can’t control the economy or your competition — but you can control your output, your mindset, and your daily habits. Own that.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">3. Build While It’s Quiet</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      This is your chance to work *on* the business, not just *in* it. Update your website, design that lead magnet, write those blogs. Plant seeds now.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">4. Talk to Your Audience</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Go live. Send a personal email. Drop a free tip. Show up. When you show you're still here, people don’t forget you when they’re ready to buy.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">5. Get Inspired by Your Future</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Visualize the version of you that already made it. Now act like them. What would they do today? That mindset shift changes everything.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-8 italic text-gray-400">
      At Daboubi, we believe tough seasons don’t last — but smart, focused marketers do. Stay consistent. Your next big breakthrough might be one step away.
