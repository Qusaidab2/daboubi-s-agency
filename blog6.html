    <p class="mb-6">
      More than 90% of businesses don't survive past 5 years. The reasons may surprise you — and they often have nothing to do with the product or service itself.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">1. No Clear Strategy</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Many businesses start with passion but no direction. Without a plan for branding, marketing, scaling, and customer experience, the business becomes reactive instead of strategic.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">2. Poor Positioning</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      If your business looks like everyone else’s — or doesn’t clearly communicate why it’s different — it becomes invisible. Positioning is what makes people care.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">3. Lack of Consistency</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Success doesn’t come from a single viral moment — it comes from consistently showing up, delivering value, and building trust. Most businesses give up too soon or pivot too often.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">4. Weak Marketing</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      A good product is not enough. If people don’t hear about it, they won’t buy it. Many businesses fail because they rely only on word of mouth or outdated methods instead of real strategy.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gold font-semibold mb-4">5. Emotional Decision Making</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Fear, ego, and impatience lead to bad calls. Success requires objectivity — tracking real data, understanding behavior, and responding with logic, not emotion.
    </p>
